# Overview

This tutorial will use all of 4 functions within the [{googledrive}](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) package:

drive_auth()         Authorize {googledrive} to access your Google Drive
drive_ls()           List contents of a folder or shared drive
drive_download()     Download a Drive file
drive_upload()       Upload into a new Drive file

This code is designed to be run locally (meaning on someone's computer manually). If the Google Drive folder is private, you need to run the authentication code first before you knit the Rmd file.

Below are examples using a publicly visible Google Drive folder. 

## Set-up

### 1. Install **googledrive** package (if needed)

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("googledrive")
```

### 2. Create a folder on Google Drive (if needed)

I have created one (it is only accessible if you are in NOAA), and it has the following sample files:

![](images/googledrive.png)

### 3. Copy the url to the Google Drive folder location*

*Only people with a NOAA email will be able to access this folder 

```{r}
url_googledrive <- "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11WnXxs56jORbLkD1mFTZxwSaShex3Sse"
id_googledrive <- "11WnXxs56jORbLkD1mFTZxwSaShex3Sse"
```

## Authorize google drive to connect to R (drive_auth)* (see more notes at the end of the tutorial)

If this is a private Google Drive folder **then you need to authorize {googledrive} to access Google Drive**

This script below works for your first time connecting and creating a "token" and later for reconnecting, but you'll need to run this outside of the R Markdown (Rmd) file. Essentially, you are giving **{googledrive}** access to your Google Drive files during the R session. This will open a window on your browser where you tell it to authenticate with your Google account. Only people with access to folders or files can access said folders or files. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
# https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes
# googledrive::drive_auth(scopes = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly", email="eli.holmes@noaa.gov")
googledrive::drive_auth()
1
```

## List the files in a google drive folder

All files.
```{r}
dir_files <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive)
dir_files$name
```

All csv files.
```{r}
dir_files <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive, type="csv")
dir_files$name
```

All Excel files.
```{r}
dir_files <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive, type="xlsx")
dir_files$name
```

All Google Spreadsheets.
```{r}
dir_files <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive, type="spreadsheet")
dir_files$name
```

All Google Documents.
```{r}
dir_files <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive, type="document")
dir_files$name
```

## Download a file

First get the files in the folder.
```{r}
a <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive)
```

### Download one Excel file from Google Drive and save to a folder called `data`.
```{r}
file_name <- "data.xlsx"
# find the id of that file
file_id <- a$id[which(a$name==file_name)]
# download the file and save to data folder
googledrive::drive_download(file=a$id[1],
                            overwrite = TRUE, 
                            path = file.path("data", file_name))
```

Read that file in using the **readxl** package.
```{r}
tmp <- readxl::read_excel(file.path(here::here(), "data", "data.xlsx"))
tmp
```

### Download one csv file on Google Drive and save to a folder called `data`.

```{r}
file_name <- "Stone.csv"
file_id <- a$id[which(a$name==file_name)]
googledrive::drive_download(file=a$id[1],
                            overwrite = TRUE, 
                            path = file.path("data", file_name))
```

Read that file in.

```{r}
tmp <- read.csv(file.path(here::here(), "data", file_name))
tmp
```

### Download a bunch of csv files from the same folder to a folder called `data`.

Download all the csv files in a Google Drive folder.

```{r}
a <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive, type = "csv")
for (i in 1:nrow(a)){
  googledrive::drive_download(a$id[i], 
                              overwrite = TRUE, 
                              path = file.path("data", a$name[i]))
}
```

### Download a bunch of Google Spreadsheets files from the same folder to a folder called `data`.

Download all the Google Spreadsheets in a Google Drive folder.

```{r}
a <- googledrive::drive_ls(path = url_googledrive, type = "spreadsheet")
for (i in 1:nrow(a)){
  googledrive::drive_download(a$id[i], 
                              type = "csv", 
                              overwrite = TRUE, 
                              path = file.path("data", a$name[i]))
}
```

## Uploading content to Google Drive

### Save a table to Google Drive

Here we have an example data set of daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973. We are going to save this table and share it back to Google Drive. 

Create table

```{r}
airquality <- datasets::airquality
head(airquality)
write.csv(x = airquality, file = "./data/airquality.csv")
```

Upload table to Google Drive

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Code won't actually work since the file is View only, but this is what you would do
googledrive::drive_upload(
  media = "./data/airquality.csv", 
  path = googledrive::as_id(id_googledrive), 
  overwrite = TRUE)
```

### Save an image to Google Drive

We can save almost any kind of content, even including images!

Create image

```{r}
jpeg(file="./data/airquality_plot.jpeg")
hist(airquality$Temp, main = "Temperature Histogram", ylab = "Temperatures")
dev.off()
```

Upload image to Google Drive

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Code won't actually work since the file is View only, but this is what you would do
drive_upload(
  media = "./data/airquality_plot.jpeg", 
  path = googledrive::as_id(id_googledrive), 
  overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Pushing results up to GitHub

Here I show how you might use the **gert** package. Note this works because I am doing it within RStudio and RStudio has permission to push to this repo. If you don't have RStudio set-up to push to GitHub, then you need to set that up first. Also you need to be working in the local repo of the GitHub repo that your are pushing to. This sounds more complicated than it is.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gert::git_add(file.path("data", "Stone.csv"))
gert::git_commit("Adding a file", author = "Eli Holmes <eli.holmes@noaa.gov>")
gert::git_push(remote = "origin", repo = ".")
```

You can also use these set ups to set up your code to run from GitHub (say) via GitHub Actions. Though you'll need to figure out how to tell the action when to run since it won't know when a file got uploaded to Google Drive. I am sure there is a way to do that though [read this](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html).

## *Advanced notes on Authorizing Google Drive

So run that once, before running the Rmd and you'll get a pop-up window asking permission for readonly access. Then in your Rmd add these lines. Obviously, add your email not mine. Note, the [gargle help file](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html) doesn't say that this is what you should do but this is what worked for me.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(
  gargle_oauth_cache = ".secrets",
  gargle_oauth_email = "eli.holmes@noaa.gov"
)
googledrive::drive_deauth()
googledrive::drive_auth(scopes = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly", email="eli.holmes@noaa.gov")
```

Make sure `.secrets` is in your `.github` file. Don't push that up to GitHub. Maybe you even want to delete that folder automatically on signing out.
